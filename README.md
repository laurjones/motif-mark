# Motif Mark

Welcome to the Motif Mark assignment repository!

## Overview

Motif Mark is an assignment designed for the practice of object-oriented programming and Pycairo. We used both to draw genes, their exons, and identify specific motifs within DNA sequences.

## Introduction

In molecular biology, a motif refers to a specific pattern or sequence within a DNA molecule that often has biological significance. Identifying motifs helps researchers understand the structure and function of genes. This assignment is a way to visualize these motifs.

## Assignment Objectives

- Implement object-oriented programming principles in Python.
- Utilize Pycairo to create visual representations of genes and motifs.
- Identify and highlight motifs within DNA sequences.

## Features
- A visualization of genes and their exons.
- A visualization of motifs within said genes.
- A legend to interpret the visual representation of each gene, exon, and motif.

## Handling capabilities
- Motifs with ambiguous nucleotides
- Multiple sequences
- Mulitple motifs

## Dependencies
- Pycairo
